# Phase 2 Implementation Progress

## Status: MOSTLY COMPLETE - DEPLOYMENT ISSUES ⚠️
**Branch**: `transit_dev`
**Date**: January 2025
**Last Updated**: End of implementation session

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Serverless Cache Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `/api/rt/[mode].js` endpoint
- ✅ Dynamic mode-based routing (ferry, train, bus)
- ✅ Route type filtering configuration
- ✅ Cache TTL management (30 seconds default)
- ✅ CORS headers configured

### 2. Cache Utilities
- ✅ Created `/lib/gtfsCache.js`
- ✅ Memory-based caching with TTL
- ✅ Stale-while-revalidate support
- ✅ Cache statistics and cleanup
- ✅ Unit tests passing

### 3. Schedule Processor Multi-Mode Support
- ✅ Added `--mode` parameter parsing
- ✅ Mode-specific configurations (ferry, train, bus)
- ✅ Route type filtering (4=ferry, 2=train, 3=bus)
- ✅ Route allow-set generation
- ✅ Mode-specific output directories
- ✅ Backward compatibility for ferry data

### 4. GitHub Actions Updates
- ✅ Updated workflow to "Update Transit Schedule"
- ✅ Matrix strategy for multiple modes (currently ferry only)
- ✅ Manual trigger with mode selection
- ✅ Mode-specific commit messages

### 5. Service Integration
- ✅ Updated `gtfsService.js` with serverless cache support
- ✅ Feature flag for cache enable/disable
- ✅ Mode configuration in services
- ✅ Route allow-set loading in `ferryData.js`

### 6. Component Updates
- ✅ `Navigation.jsx` uses mode configuration for branding
- ✅ `DepartureItem.jsx` uses mode configuration for service types
- ✅ `useFerryData` hook passes mode config to services

## Issues Encountered & Fixed

### 1. TypeError in useModeConfig
**Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')`
**Cause**: Function expected a path parameter but was called without one
**Fix**: Added check for undefined path, returns full config if no path

### 2. Schedule Processor Variable Scoping
**Issue**: `ferryStops` and `ferryRoutes` hardcoded in processor
**Fix**: Renamed to `modeStops` and `modeRoutes`, made dynamic

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Cache TTL | 30s | 30s | ✅ |
| Cache hit rate | >90% | Pending | ⚠️ |
| Response time | <200ms | Untested | ⚠️ |
| API call reduction | >90% | Untested | ⚠️ |

## Current Implementation Status

### What's Complete ✅
1. **GTFS Protobuf Filtering**
   - Full parsing and filtering implemented in `/api/rt/[mode].js`
   - Filters by route type and route prefix
   - Proper error handling with fallback

2. **Mode-Specific Schedule Paths**
   - Dynamic path generation based on mode
   - Fallback to root `/schedule-data/latest.json` for ferry
   - Cache keys include mode for separation
   - NOTE: Mode-specific directories don't exist yet on GitHub Pages

3. **Service Integration**
   - All services (GTFS, static, ferryData) are mode-aware
   - Route allow-set loading implemented
   - Feature flag for cache enable/disable

4. **Component Updates**
   - Navigation uses mode branding
   - DepartureItem uses mode service types
   - useFerryData hook passes mode config to services

### Remaining Issues ⚠️

#### Critical Issues Found During Deployment:
1. **Infinite Loop Bug (FIXED)**
   - `ferryRoutes` undefined error - Fixed by renaming to `modeRoutes`
   - Dependency array issues - Fixed by using `modeId` instead of full config

2. **Render Loop Issues (PARTIALLY FIXED)**
   - Still experiencing some flickering
   - 404 errors for `/schedule-data/ferry/latest.json` (path doesn't exist)
   - Fallback to root path is working but causing repeated fetches

3. **Missing Infrastructure**
   - Mode-specific schedule directories not created on GitHub Pages
   - Need to run schedule processor with `--mode ferry` to create directories
   - Serverless functions only testable on Vercel (not local)

### What's NOT Working ❌
1. **Serverless Cache on Vercel**
   - Endpoint exists but untested with real GTFS data
   - Can't test locally (Vite doesn't run Vercel functions)

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Cache hit rate: Unknown
   - API call reduction: Not measured
   - Response times: Not benchmarked

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Vercel KV for persistent caching**
   - Currently memory-only cache
   - Will reset on cold starts

2. **Implement cache warming strategy**
   - Pre-fetch popular routes
   - Reduce cold start impact

3. **Add performance monitoring**
   - Track cache hit rates
   - Monitor response times

## Testing Status

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests |
|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| Cache utilities | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Serverless endpoint | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Schedule processor | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Service integration | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Code Quality

- **New files created**: 4
- **Files modified**: 10+
- **Lines added**: ~500
- **Lines removed**: ~50
- **Test coverage**: ~20%

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. **Environment variable**: `VITE_USE_CACHE=false` to disable cache
2. **Mode testing**: Add `?mode=train` to URL to test mode detection
3. **Schedule processing**: Run with `node process-schedule.js --mode ferry`

### For Deployment
1. **Vercel configuration** needed for serverless functions
2. **Environment variables** for cache configuration
3. **GitHub Actions** currently only processes ferry mode

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Cache stampede | High | Medium | Stale-while-revalidate implemented |
| Protobuf parsing errors | High | Low | Need error handling in endpoint |
| Memory limits | Medium | Medium | Need Vercel KV for large datasets |
| Cold start latency | Low | High | Cache warming strategy needed |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 3-4)
1. Complete protobuf filtering in serverless endpoint
2. Test with real GTFS-RT data
3. Update static service for multi-mode paths
4. Add error handling and logging

### Phase 2 Completion (Day 5)
1. Performance testing and benchmarking
2. Documentation updates
3. Integration testing
4. Prepare for Phase 3 (train mode)

## Dependencies

### Required for Production
- Vercel serverless functions
- TransLink API access
- GitHub Actions for schedule processing

### Optional Enhancements
- Vercel KV for persistence
- Monitoring service (Datadog, New Relic)
- CDN for static assets

## Success Criteria Progress

- [ ] API calls reduced by >90%
- [ ] Response time <200ms P95
- [ ] Cache hit rate >90%
- [ ] Zero regression in ferry functionality
- [x] Components using configuration system
- [x] Schedule processor supports multi-mode

## Next Steps for Phase 2 Completion

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Render Loop**
   - Investigate why fallback is causing repeated fetches
   - May need to debounce or cache fallback attempts
   - Consider disabling route allow-set loading temporarily

2. **Create Mode-Specific Directories**
   - Run GitHub Action with schedule processor
   - Create `/schedule-data/ferry/latest.json`
   - This will eliminate 404 errors

3. **Test Serverless Functions**
   - Deploy to Vercel and test `/api/rt/ferry` endpoint
   - Verify GTFS filtering is working
   - Check cache hit rates in Vercel logs

### Progress vs Original Plan

Referring to [@docs/brisbanetransit-plan.md Section 7.2]:
- ✅ Phase 1: Mode abstraction - COMPLETE
- ⚠️ Phase 2: Shared infrastructure - 80% COMPLETE
  - Serverless cache built but needs testing
  - Multi-mode processor ready but not deployed
  - Components updated but render issues remain
- ⏳ Phase 3: Train mode - NOT STARTED
- ⏳ Phase 4-6: Bus mode and beyond - NOT STARTED

### Technical Debt Accumulated:
1. Render loop issues need resolution
2. Mode-specific paths need GitHub Actions run
3. Serverless cache needs production testing
4. Performance metrics not measured

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered:
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D transit_dev
```

Or disable cache:
```javascript
// .env.local or Vercel env
VITE_USE_CACHE=false
```

## Summary for Next Session

**Where we left off:**
- Phase 2 is functionally complete but has deployment issues
- Main blocker: Render loops and missing mode-specific schedule data
- Serverless cache implemented but untested in production
- Need to run schedule processor to create `/schedule-data/ferry/` directory

**Quick fixes needed:**
1. Debug and fix render loop (might be in useEffect dependencies)
2. Run GitHub Action to create mode-specific directories
3. Test serverless cache on Vercel deployment

**Ready for Phase 3 after:**
- Render loops resolved
- Serverless cache verified working
- Performance metrics collected
