# Brisbane Ferry Tracker - Project Guide for Claude

## Project Overview
This is a single-page application that displays real-time ferry departures between Bulimba and Riverside ferry terminals in Brisbane. It combines static GTFS schedule data with real-time GTFS-RT updates to show accurate ferry times even when services aren't actively running.

## Current Deployment Status

### Primary Production Deployment: Vercel
**URL**: https://brisbane-ferry-tracker.vercel.app/
**Custom Domain**: https://ferry.lifemap.au/
- ‚úÖ **Full functionality** - Live tracking + schedule data
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates** via CORS proxy
- ‚úÖ **GitHub-hosted schedule** loaded first (fast)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic fallback** to local GTFS processing
- ‚úÖ **Ferry details modal** with comprehensive information
- ‚úÖ **Interactive map** with live ferry positions

### Secondary Deployment: GitHub Pages
**URL**: https://thebnut.github.io/brisbane-ferry-tracker/
- ‚úÖ **Schedule data only** (no live tracking)
- ‚ùå **No CORS proxy** (cannot access TransLink API)
- ‚úÖ **Daily updates** via GitHub Actions
- üí° **Use case**: Schedule reference when Vercel is down

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Progressive Loading Strategy
The app uses a two-stage loading approach for optimal user experience:
1. **Real-time data loads first** (fast) - Shows live ferries immediately
2. **Schedule data loads in background** (slow) - 30MB download that merges seamlessly

### Live Ferry Map
Interactive map showing real-time ferry positions:
- Uses Leaflet + React Leaflet for mapping
- Displays ferry locations from VehiclePositions GTFS-RT feed
- Shows only ferries traveling between Bulimba and Riverside
- Updates every 5 minutes with live data
- Visual indicators for Express (üö§) vs All-stops (üö¢) services
- Popups show speed, occupancy, and next departure

### Data Sources
1. **Pre-processed Schedule Data** (Primary)
   - GitHub Pages hosted JSON (`https://thebnut.github.io/brisbane-ferry-tracker/data/latest.json`)
   - Generated daily at 3 AM Brisbane time via GitHub Actions
   - ~50KB filtered data (vs 30MB raw GTFS)
   - Cached in localStorage for 24 hours
   - Fallback to local development path when on localhost

2. **Static GTFS Data** (`/api/gtfs-static`) - Fallback only
   - ZIP file containing full schedule (~30MB)
   - Used only if GitHub data unavailable
   - Processed client-side

3. **Real-time GTFS-RT Data** (`/api/gtfs-proxy`)
   - Protobuf format real-time updates
   - Shows only actively running services
   - Takes precedence over scheduled data when available
   - Loads immediately on app start

### Important Constants
```javascript
// Stop IDs (from TransLink GTFS)
STOPS = {
  bulimba: "317584",      // Bulimba ferry terminal
  riverside: "317590",    // Riverside ferry terminal  
  apolloRoad: "317533"    // Apollo Road (near Bulimba) - currently unused
}

// Route IDs
ROUTES = {
  expressCityCat: "F11",    // Express service
  allStopsCityCat: "F1"     // All-stops service
}

// GTFS-RT Occupancy Status Values
OCCUPANCY_STATUS = {
  0: 'Empty',
  1: 'Many seats available',
  2: 'Few seats available',
  3: 'Standing room only',
  4: 'Crushed standing room only',
  5: 'Full',
  6: 'Not accepting passengers'
}

// GTFS-RT Vehicle Status Values
VEHICLE_STATUS = {
  0: 'Approaching stop',
  1: 'Stopped at terminal',
  2: 'In transit'
}
```

Note: Real-time routes may have suffixes like "F11-4055", so we use `startsWith()` for matching.
Note: GTFS-RT may send numeric or string enum values - the app handles both formats.

### Dynamic Stop Selector
Users can now select any ferry terminal pair (not just Bulimba-Riverside):
- On first visit: Modal prompts to select origin and destination stops
- Selections persist in localStorage
- Only shows destinations with direct ferry connections from selected origin
- Settings gear icon allows changing stops anytime

### Critical Filtering Logic
The app filters departures to show ONLY ferries that actually travel between the selected terminals:

1. **Initial Filter**: Trip must contain BOTH selected stops
2. **Direction Filter**: For each departure, verify the ferry goes TO the other terminal
   - Origin departures: Must have destination AFTER current position
   - Destination departures: Must have origin AFTER current position

See `schedule-filtering-logic.md` for detailed explanation.

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (no Redux/Context needed)
- Custom `useFerryData` hook handles all data fetching and progressive loading
- Separate loading states for initial load vs schedule load
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes + countdown timer every second

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS v3 (not v4 - important for compatibility)
- Custom colors: golden, ferry-blue, charcoal, cream
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Wrong branch for development
**Solution:** Always work on `develop` branch
```bash
git checkout develop
```

### Issue: No departures showing
**Causes:**
1. Outside service hours (check if showing scheduled times)
2. Incorrect stop/route filtering
3. CORS issues with API

**Debug:**
- Check console for filtering logs
- Verify GTFS data is being fetched
- Check if cached data exists in localStorage

### Issue: Cache errors
**Solution:** Cache only processed departures, not raw GTFS data (30MB ‚Üí 50KB)

### Issue: Slow initial load
**Solution:** Progressive loading - show live data immediately while schedule loads in background

### Issue: Wrong direction ferries showing
**Solution:** Check stop sequence to ensure ferry goes FROM current stop TO other terminal

### Issue: CORS errors on custom domain
**Solution:** Always use the proxy endpoint (`/api/gtfs-proxy`) for all deployments. The app now automatically uses the proxy to avoid CORS issues regardless of domain.

### Issue: Numeric enum values showing instead of text
**Solution:** Use `getOccupancyInfo()` and `getVehicleStatusInfo()` helper functions that handle both numeric and string enum values from GTFS-RT.

### Issue: LIVE tags not showing for non-Bulimba/Riverside routes
**Solution:** The app originally had hardcoded stop IDs. Now fixed to use dynamic selectedStops:
- `ferryData.js`: Uses `this.selectedStops` instead of hardcoded `STOPS.bulimba`/`STOPS.riverside`
- `staticGtfsService.js`: Accepts selectedStops parameter and uses it throughout
- Critical: Always pass selectedStops when calling `getScheduledDepartures()`

## Testing & Debugging

### Key Debug Points
1. `ferryData.js:filterRelevantTrips()` - Shows which trips pass initial filter
2. `ferryData.js:checkDestination()` - Shows direction filtering
3. `staticGtfsService.js:getScheduledDepartures()` - Shows static schedule processing

### Test Scenarios
1. Early morning (4-5 AM): Should show scheduled times
2. Peak hours: Should show mix of live and scheduled
3. Late night: Should show next day's first services
4. After 12:30 PM on mobile: Should default to inbound tab (return journey)
5. Click any departure: Should show detailed modal with all available info
6. Test with different stop pairs: Hawthorne-Riverside, Bulimba-Northshore Hamilton, etc.

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev     # Starts on http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # Test production build
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test real-time data
curl http://localhost:5173/api/gtfs-proxy?endpoint=TripUpdates

# Test static GTFS
curl http://localhost:5173/api/gtfs-static -o gtfs.zip
```

## Performance Considerations
1. Static GTFS ZIP is ~30MB - fetched once and cached
2. Schedule cache expires after 24 hours (but validates against GitHub's timestamp)
3. Real-time updates every 5 minutes
4. Countdown timers update every second (force re-render)

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Timezone Handling in Schedule Processor
**CRITICAL**: GTFS schedule times are in local timezone (Brisbane). When processing:
```javascript
// WRONG - causes 10-hour offset
const departureZoned = toZonedTime(departureDate, TIMEZONE);

// CORRECT - converts Brisbane time to UTC for storage
const departureUTC = fromZonedTime(departureDate, TIMEZONE);
```

### Cache Validation
Always check if GitHub has newer data before using cache:
- Compare `generated` timestamps between cache and GitHub
- Prevents users being stuck with buggy data for 24 hours
- Implemented in `staticGtfsService.getScheduledDepartures()`

## Deployment Architecture

## Common Data Flow Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Scheduled Departures Not Showing Arrival Times
**Problem**: Scheduled ferries showed "Arrival time not available" instead of actual arrival times.

**Root Causes**:
1. **GitHub Schedule Data Structure**: The schedule processor generates ALL ferry departures for ALL stops without pre-calculating arrival times for specific stop pairs
2. **Missing Client-Side Processing**: The app was using raw GitHub data without:
   - Filtering for selected stops
   - Calculating arrival times from trip data
   - Verifying trips go between selected terminals
3. **Double Filtering**: After processing, ferryData.js was applying additional filtering that removed all scheduled departures

**Solution**:
1. **Added `processGitHubDepartures` method** in staticGtfsService.js:
   - Groups departures by tripId to find complete trips
   - Filters for selected stops and ferry routes
   - Finds destination stops and calculates arrival times
   - Only includes trips that go between selected terminals

2. **Skip Double Filtering** in ferryData.js:
   - Check if departures already have `direction` property (indicates processing)
   - Skip additional filtering for pre-processed departures

3. **GTFS Time Handling**:
   - GTFS uses "arrival_time" and "departure_time" fields
   - If arrival_time is missing, fall back to departure_time
   - For schedule data, arrival ‚âà departure - 1 minute at ferry stops

**Key Learning**: When using pre-processed data (GitHub), ensure client-side processing matches what the GTFS fallback path does. Don't assume pre-processed data is ready to use directly.

### Ferry Data Status Levels
The app has three distinct data availability states for ferry departures, now clearly indicated by badge combinations:

1. **Scheduled Only**
   - Source: GTFS static schedule data
   - Shows: Planned departure/arrival times
   - Badges: "SCHEDULED" (gray)
   - No real-time updates

2. **Live (Schedule Updates Only)**
   - Source: GTFS-RT TripUpdates feed
   - Shows: Real-time departure delays/updates
   - Badges: "LIVE" (green with pulse) only
   - Has `isRealtime: true` but no GPS position
   - Common when ferry is at terminal or GPS unavailable

3. **Live (Full GPS Tracking)**
   - Source: GTFS-RT TripUpdates + VehiclePositions feeds
   - Shows: Everything above PLUS:
     - Live position on map
     - Current speed
     - Occupancy status
     - Vehicle status (approaching/stopped/in transit)
   - Badges: "LIVE" (green with pulse) + "GPS" (green with pulse, location icon)
   - Has both `isRealtime: true` AND `position` data

**Badge Logic**:
- "LIVE" badge: Appears when `departure.isRealtime === true` (real-time schedule updates)
- "GPS" badge: Appears when `hasLiveData === true` (GPS position available)
- Both badges can appear independently, providing clear visibility into data availability
- GPS-dependent features (map, speed, occupancy) only show when GPS badge is present

## Future Enhancements to Consider
1. Service alerts integration
2. Walking time to terminal
3. Favorite routes
4. Push notifications for imminent departures
5. Historical reliability data
