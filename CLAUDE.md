# Brisbane Ferry Tracker - Project Guide for Claude

## Project Overview
This is a single-page application that displays real-time ferry departures between Bulimba and Riverside ferry terminals in Brisbane. It combines static GTFS schedule data with real-time GTFS-RT updates to show accurate ferry times even when services aren't actively running.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Progressive Loading Strategy
The app uses a two-stage loading approach for optimal user experience:
1. **Real-time data loads first** (fast) - Shows live ferries immediately
2. **Schedule data loads in background** (slow) - 30MB download that merges seamlessly

### Data Sources
1. **Pre-processed Schedule Data** (Primary)
   - GitHub Pages hosted JSON (`https://thebnut.github.io/brisbane-ferry-tracker/data/latest.json`)
   - Generated daily at 3 AM Brisbane time via GitHub Actions
   - ~50KB filtered data (vs 30MB raw GTFS)
   - Cached in localStorage for 24 hours
   - Fallback to local development path when on localhost

2. **Static GTFS Data** (`/api/gtfs-static`) - Fallback only
   - ZIP file containing full schedule (~30MB)
   - Used only if GitHub data unavailable
   - Processed client-side

3. **Real-time GTFS-RT Data** (`/api/gtfs-proxy`)
   - Protobuf format real-time updates
   - Shows only actively running services
   - Takes precedence over scheduled data when available
   - Loads immediately on app start

### Important Constants
```javascript
// Stop IDs (from TransLink GTFS)
STOPS = {
  bulimba: "317584",      // Bulimba ferry terminal
  riverside: "317590",    // Riverside ferry terminal  
  apolloRoad: "317533"    // Apollo Road (near Bulimba) - currently unused
}

// Route IDs
ROUTES = {
  expressCityCat: "F11",    // Express service
  allStopsCityCat: "F1"     // All-stops service
}
```

Note: Real-time routes may have suffixes like "F11-4055", so we use `startsWith()` for matching.

### Critical Filtering Logic
The app filters departures to show ONLY ferries that actually travel between the two terminals:

1. **Initial Filter**: Trip must contain BOTH Bulimba AND Riverside stops
2. **Direction Filter**: For each departure, verify the ferry goes TO the other terminal
   - Bulimba departures: Must have Riverside AFTER current position
   - Riverside departures: Must have Bulimba AFTER current position

See `schedule-filtering-logic.md` for detailed explanation.

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (no Redux/Context needed)
- Custom `useFerryData` hook handles all data fetching and progressive loading
- Separate loading states for initial load vs schedule load
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes + countdown timer every second

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS v3 (not v4 - important for compatibility)
- Custom colors: golden, ferry-blue, charcoal, cream
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No departures showing
**Causes:**
1. Outside service hours (check if showing scheduled times)
2. Incorrect stop/route filtering
3. CORS issues with API

**Debug:**
- Check console for filtering logs
- Verify GTFS data is being fetched
- Check if cached data exists in localStorage

### Issue: Cache errors
**Solution:** Cache only processed departures, not raw GTFS data (30MB â†’ 50KB)

### Issue: Slow initial load
**Solution:** Progressive loading - show live data immediately while schedule loads in background

### Issue: Wrong direction ferries showing
**Solution:** Check stop sequence to ensure ferry goes FROM current stop TO other terminal

## Testing & Debugging

### Key Debug Points
1. `ferryData.js:filterRelevantTrips()` - Shows which trips pass initial filter
2. `ferryData.js:checkDestination()` - Shows direction filtering
3. `staticGtfsService.js:getScheduledDepartures()` - Shows static schedule processing

### Test Scenarios
1. Early morning (4-5 AM): Should show scheduled times
2. Peak hours: Should show mix of live and scheduled
3. Late night: Should show next day's first services

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev     # Starts on http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # Test production build
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test real-time data
curl http://localhost:5173/api/gtfs-proxy?endpoint=TripUpdates

# Test static GTFS
curl http://localhost:5173/api/gtfs-static -o gtfs.zip
```

## Performance Considerations
1. Static GTFS ZIP is ~30MB - fetched once and cached
2. Schedule cache expires after 24 hours
3. Real-time updates every 5 minutes
4. Countdown timers update every second (force re-render)

## Deployment Notes
- Vercel serverless functions handle CORS proxy
- Environment variables not needed (API URLs are public)
- Static GTFS cache works per-user (localStorage)

## Recent Updates
1. **GitHub Pages Schedule Caching** - Pre-processed schedule data served from GitHub
2. **Progressive Loading** - Live data shows immediately, schedule loads in background
3. **TripId-based Merging** - Accurate matching of real-time and scheduled departures
4. **"More..." Button** - Shows up to 13 departures (5 + 8 more)
5. **Scheduled Time Display** - Shows "(Sched HH:MM AM/PM)" for live departures
6. **Dynamic Status Messages** - Different messages based on available data
7. **First-time Loading Message** - Warns users about initial download time
8. **Configurable Debug Logging** - Set DEBUG_CONFIG.enableLogging to true

## Future Enhancements to Consider
1. Service alerts integration
2. Walking time to terminal
3. Favorite routes
4. Push notifications for imminent departures
5. Historical reliability data
